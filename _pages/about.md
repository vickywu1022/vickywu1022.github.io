Hi! I'm Weiqi (Vicky) Wu, a first-year postgraduate student (enroll in Sep. 2023) majored in computer science at the school of electronic information and electircal engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University.

My research interests are about natural language processing and knowledge graph. Through all my research projects and participation in workshops, contests and conferences, I have gained invaluable knowledge and skills in the domains I love. Guided by my curiosity and dedication, I am committed to continuous exploration and advancement in these dynamic and evolving fields.
