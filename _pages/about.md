Hi! I'm Weiqi (Vicky) Wu, a second year graduate student majored in computer science at School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm advised by Prof. Hai Zhao.

My research interests are about natural language processing and knowledge graph, including **Agent, RAG, Role-playing LLMs and Knowledge Probing**. I’m also serveing as reviewer for ACL Rolling Review.

I’m currently working as a Research Intern at Alibaba TongYi Lab, mainly focusing on open-domain RAG Agents.
