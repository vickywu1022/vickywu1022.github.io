Hi! I'm Weiqi (Vicky) Wu, a first year graduate student majored in computer science at School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests are about natural language processing and knowledge graph, including **knowledge probing, information extraction and KG-based recommendation system**. Recently, I've been looking into **model compression** techniques. Through all my research projects and participation in workshops, contests and conferences, I have gained invaluable knowledge and committed to continuous exploration in these evolving fields.
