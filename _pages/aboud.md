Hi! I'm Weiqi (Vicky) Wu, a second-year master student majoring in computer science at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm advised by Prof. Hai Zhao.

My research interests are about Large Language Models and Agents, including Reasoning, RAG, Role-playing LLMs and Knowledge Probing. I‚Äôm also serving as a reviewer for ACL Rolling Review. Additionally, I am honored to receive the **ACL 2023 Outstanding Paper Award üèÜ**, which further fuels my passion for advancing the field. 

During the past year, I worked as a Research Intern at Alibaba TongYi Lab, focusing on open-domain RAG and Web Agents. Currently, I am interning at ByteDance‚Äôs Data team as part of the *JinDouYun* talent program, where I am primarily working on applying LLMs to personalized recommendations in the DouBao APP. 

Graduating in March 2026, I'm actively seeking opportunities related to LLMs and Agents. I just joined LinkedIn so üëâ [Let's connect !](linkedin.com/in/weiqi-wu-08337a34b)
