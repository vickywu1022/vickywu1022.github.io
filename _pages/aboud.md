Hi! I'm Weiqi (Vicky) Wu, a CS Master's student at the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Hai Zhao.

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models and Agents. My expertise spans Reasoning, RAG, Role-playing LLMs, and Knowledge Probing. I am honored to have received the **ACL 2023 Outstanding Paper Award 🏆**, which further fuels my passion for advancing the field. 

Currently, I am interning at **ByteDance Seed**, where I focus on foundation models and global applications. Previously, I worked within ByteDance’s Data team as part of the *JinDouYun* talent program on personalized recommendations for the DouBao APP and interned at Alibaba TongYi Lab focusing on open-domain RAG and Web Agents.

🎓 **Seeking 2026 Opportunities**: I graduate in March 2026 and am eager to connect with teams working on the next generation of LLMs and Agents. I just joined LinkedIn so 👉 [Let's connect !](https://linkedin.com/in/weiqi-wu-08337a34b)
