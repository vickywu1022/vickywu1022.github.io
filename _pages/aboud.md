Hi! I'm Weiqi (Vicky) Wu, a second-year master student majoring in computer science at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm advised by Prof. Hai Zhao.

My research interests are about natural language processing and knowledge graph, including **Agent, RAG, Role-playing LLMs and Knowledge Probing**. I’m also serving as a reviewer for ACL Rolling Review. Additionally, I was honored to receive the **ACL 2023 Outstanding Paper Award 🏆**, which further fueled my passion for advancing the field. 

During the past year, I worked as a Research Intern at Alibaba TongYi Lab, focusing on open-domain RAG and reasoning & search agents. Currently, I am interning at ByteDance’s Data team as part of the *JinDouYun* talent program, where I am primarily working on applying LLMs to personalized recommendations in the DouBao APP. 

I will graduate in March 2026 and am actively seeking fall recruitment opportunities related to LLMs.
